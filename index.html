        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="leftxt">Hi, my name is Ethan Labbe and I am a third year Electrical Engineer. I was born and raised
            in Edmonton, Alberta and have a passion for learning and research
            that solves real-world problems and makes a positive impact on people's lives. I have a strong
            foundation in Engineering and a wide variety of skills from circuit design to programming, that I have
            learned at the University of Alberta. See my projects below to learn more about my work.

        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <div class="leftxt">

            <h3>Python Automation</h3>
            <p>This project is a general automation software designed to automate and streamline online processes. 
                This project is being programmed in Python and incorporates applications of data collection,
                web scraping and automation on top of the machine learning framework.
                This project is currently in a preliminary stage... more to come soon.</p>

            <h3>IOT Solar PV Home Automation Project</h3>
            <p> I am designing and building an automated solar panel that rotates to the optimal angle based off of
                light detected from the sun using photoresistors. This Project uses a arduino board to calculate and 
                send signals to servo motors to rotate based off of C++ code.
                The aim of the project is to reach maximum output from a single solar panel by experimenting with solar PVs to
                determine if the overall net energy output increases 
                from automating solar PVs. Documents and photos will be uploaded soon.
            </p>

            <h3>Fusion Energy Fuel Research Project</h3>
            <p>For this project I am researching and addressing the issues of inertial confinement fusion fuel pellets. This project was created and
                funded under the Dean's Research Award and is supervised by Dr. Ying Tsui. Aiming to find solutions to the cost and quality control issues of
                the current manufacturing methods this project is currently underway and will conclude in December 2023
            </p>

            <h3><a target="_blank" href="DRAposter.pdf">Underwater Autonomous Vehicle Control Simulation (UAVCS)</a></h3>
            <p> UAVCS is a python program written with the help of Dr. James Myatt for the Dean's Research
                Award. This project is the creation a control simulation for a 6-degree of freedom underwater
                vehicle, the project focuses on the scopes of control theory, python programming and underwater
                vehicle dynamics. From the physics of an underwater vehicle I created graphical simulations by solving
                a system of differential equations to determine the depth of the vehicle for varying conditions.
                The autonomous vehicle CAD design and simulations can be seen below.
